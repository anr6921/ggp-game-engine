// - Allows us to define a buffer of individual variables 
//    which will (eventually) hold data from our C++ code
// - All non-pipeline variables that get their values from 
//    our C++ code must be defined inside a Constant Buffer

// 
// - Input is exactly one vertex worth of data (defined by a struct)
// - Output is a single struct of data to pass down the pipeline
// - Named "main" because that's the default the shader compiler looks for

	// screen and the distance (Z) from the camera (the "depth" of the pixel)
